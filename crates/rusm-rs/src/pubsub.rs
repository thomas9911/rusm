//! Keyed publish/subscribe **fan-out** — the broker *mechanics* as a reusable
//! primitive, so an app never hand-rolls subscriber tracking, fan-out, or dead-peer
//! cleanup. Embed [`Topics`] in a process and you get:
//!   - `subscribe(topic, pid)` — register a subscriber and **monitor** it,
//!   - `publish(topic, msg)` — fan a message out to a topic's subscribers,
//!   - automatic **pruning** of a dead subscriber (clean exit *or* crash) the moment
//!     its monitor `__down` arrives — the crash-safe OTP cleanup, no protocol needed.
//!
//! Separation of concerns: this owns the *mechanism*; the app owns the *content* —
//! which topics exist, what is published, and any late-join snapshot (which reads the
//! app's own state). The app's loop just routes inbound messages:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let mut topics = Topics::new();
//! loop {
//!     let msg = rusm_rs::receive_bytes();
//!     if topics.handle_down(&msg) { continue; }   // a subscriber died → pruned
//!     match parse(&msg) {
//!         Sub { topic, pid } => topics.subscribe(&topic, pid),  // + snapshot, app's call
//!         Pub { topic, data } => topics.publish(&topic, &data),
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Auto-pruning needs the **monitor** capability (`process_control` or `spawn`); a
//! subscriber whose monitor was denied still receives fan-out but isn't pruned on death.
