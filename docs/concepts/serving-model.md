# Concept — the serving model (process-per-unit-of-work)

A RUSM component can be a high-throughput **HTTP / WebSocket / SSE** server. The host
owns the socket and the protocol; the guest just produces responses — in Rust or
[TypeScript](./guests-rust-and-typescript.md). `rusm-otp` stays Wasm-free; all the
serving machinery (hyper, tungstenite, `wasi:http`) lives only in `rusm-wasm`.

## One shape, by design

Serving is **always process-per-unit-of-work** — there is no "resident" mode to choose:

- **HTTP / SSE** — a fresh, sandboxed WASM instance **per request**.
- **WS** — one sandboxed component process **per connection**.

This single choice buys properties you'd otherwise have to engineer around:

- **No head-of-line blocking, ever.** Each request gets its own instance, so a slow or
  blocking handler can't stall the next request.
- **Crash containment.** A trap fails *just that* request or socket — never the listener
  or the other clients. There is no shared instance to corrupt.
- **Total isolation.** Each instance has its own linear memory and its own default-deny
  [capability profile](./permissions-and-sandboxing.md).
- **Cheap.** Per-request instances ride the pooled spawn path (pooling allocator + CoW
  linear memory + precomputed export index), ~440k component spawns/sec; RSS tracks only
  live instances.

## Where state goes

The serving instance is stateless and disposable. Anything that must outlive a request
lives elsewhere — **never** in the serving instance:

- a **`[[components]]` service** — a long-lived, supervised, stateful process reached
  over the actor API (`whereis` / `call` / `send`): a counter, cache, session map,
  pub/sub hub, chat-room registry; or
- durable **`kv`** for state that must survive restarts.

This is where the old "resident vs per-call" decision now lives: a `[[components]]`
**service** holds state; a **worker** spawns per call. Serving components are always
per-request. A handler that needs state simply `call`s a service and shapes the reply.

## Declarative routing

Routing lives in a per-listener `rusm.toml` **`[serve.routes]`** subtable — never in
handler code. Each `[[serve]]` HTTP/SSE listener has its own `[serve.routes]`, so
multiple listeners (e.g. a public API and an admin port) route independently. A key is
`"METHOD /path/pattern"`, a value is `"component#action"`:

- `:name` captures a path parameter (read via `Params::get("name")`);
- a trailing `*` captures the remaining segments;
- the separator is `#` (`:` and `.` are reserved by RUSM's scheme/file conventions).

Matching is by specificity (literal > `:param` > `*`). A path that matches but not for
the method → **405**; no match → **404**.

## Handlers are named actions

A Rust serving component is a module of `pub fn`s under `#[rusm_rs::handlers]` — no
`main`, no router, no wire plumbing. The macro generates the whole component shell and
the action dispatch; the developer writes only handler functions:

- a 2-arg action `fn(Request, Params) -> Response` is **buffered**;
- a 3-arg action `fn(Request, Params, Sse)` **streams SSE** — and since each request is
  its own process, it may block for the whole connection.

TypeScript serving uses web standards instead (the macro is Rust): HTTP/SSE
`export default` a `fetch`-shaped handler (SSE returns a `ReadableStream` body); WS uses
`export default websocket({ open, message })`, one worker per connection.

## How it works

- **HTTP / SSE** ride `wasi:http`. The host gateway resolves the route, spawns the
  matched handler fresh, dispatches the action over the actor wire, and turns the reply
  into the response — buffered, or for SSE a chunked streamed body draining the guest's
  back-pressured byte stream (see [byte streams](./byte-streams.md)).
- **WebSocket** upgrades host-side; each inbound frame becomes a mailbox message, and
  replies go out through a Wasm-free **writer process** that owns the socket sink — one
  isolated process per connection.
- An ephemeral Wasm-free **responder** process owns the reply hand-off so the sandboxed
  guest never touches a socket.
- **Standards-first:** a stock `wasi:http` component serves unchanged; the
  `rusm:runtime` actor world is opt-in.

## Serving and RPC unify

A serving handler and an actor-world service are the same thing — a component exporting
named functions. A handler **action** is reachable via an HTTP route; a service
**function** via an actor `call`. Same wire, same spawn model. So "shared state" is just
"a component you `call`."

## How it's benchmarked (honestly)

Serving throughput is measured **out-of-process** by the `rusm-loadtest` binary against
a real `rusm serve` port, so the load generator never steals the server's CPU and the
number is the server's — see the [benchmark reference](../03-benchmark-dashboard.md).

See the full [serving guide](../serving-http-ws-sse.md) for routing syntax, the
`#[rusm_rs::handlers]` macro, the `Sse` API, the TypeScript path, and a worked example;
the `[[serve]]` and `[serve.routes]` schema is in the
[configuration reference](../reference-configuration.md).
