# Lifecycle — WebSocket component

One sandboxed component process **per connection**. The host owns the socket and
delivers each inbound frame to the process's mailbox; the process replies through a
writer pid. See the [overview](./component-lifecycle.md) for the shared two-domain
model and failure vocabulary.

## Shape (what you write)

```rust
use rusm_rs::ws::{self, Connection, Handler};

struct Echo;
impl Handler for Echo {
    fn open(&mut self, conn: &Connection) {
        conn.send(b"welcome\n");
    }
    fn message(&mut self, conn: &Connection, data: Vec<u8>) {
        conn.send(&data); // echo this connection's frame
    }
}

#[rusm_rs::main]
fn run() {
    ws::serve(Echo);
}
```

There is **one handler instance per connection**, so `&mut self` is *this connection's*
state — no cross-connection sharing. (TypeScript: `export default websocket({ open,
message })` from the `rusm-ts` package, one worker per connection.)

## Platform owns / you write

- **Platform owns:** the upgrade handshake, the socket and its **writer process** (a
  Wasm-free process that owns the sink — message 1 to your process is its pid),
  delivering inbound frames as mailbox messages, and **killing** the process when the
  socket closes.
- **You write:** `open` / `message`, replying with `conn.send(…)`.

## Lifecycle events

| Event | Platform domain | Application domain | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Normal** open + frames | upgrade → spawn → deliver msg 1 = writer pid → each frame as a message | `open`, then `message` per frame, replying via `conn.send` | frames handled/echoed |
| **Client disconnect** (clean close) | detects the close and **kills** the per-connection process; reclaims the writer | the process is torn down (no `close` callback needed) | socket closed; resources reclaimed |
| **Connection error** (reset, bad frame, protocol error) | the connection task ends; the process is killed | — | that connection gone |
| **Crash (trap)** in a handler | the process is Crashed; the platform tears down its writer + socket | the `panic!` / `.unwrap()` | that connection dropped; **all others + the listener untouched** |
| **Memory crash (OOM)** | the `StoreLimiter` cap trips a trap → handled like a crash | exceeded `max-memory-mb` | that connection dropped; the instance discarded |

## Notes

- **Containment by construction.** Connections share nothing, so a crash or OOM is
  contained to one client — there is no shared instance whose failure could affect
  others.
- **No `close` callback — and none needed.** The per-connection process *is* the
  connection; when the socket closes the platform kills the process, and exit cascades
  ([links](./links-and-supervision.md)) clean up anything it owned. Shared state (rooms,
  presence) belongs in a [service component](./lifecycle-service.md), not in the
  per-connection process.
- **Establishment cost is a spawn.** Each new connection is a fresh sandboxed
  process — the connection-storm benchmark measures exactly this
  (sandboxed-process-per-connection establishments per second).
