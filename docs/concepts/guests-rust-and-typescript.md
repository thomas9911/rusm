# Concept — guests: Rust & TypeScript

A RUSM process body can be written in **Rust** (`rusm-rs`) or **TypeScript**
(`rusm-ts`). Both compile/bundle to a sandboxed Wasm process with the same actor API
and the same JSON wire — so a Rust client and a TypeScript service interoperate
transparently.

## Rust guests (`rusm-rs`)

Ergonomic `Pid` / `send` / `receive` / `spawn` / registry / `Stream`, plus a
`#[rusm_rs::service]` macro that generates the receive → dispatch → reply loop **and**
a typed `Client` with call / cast / streaming / callbacks. `rusm build` compiles each
`components/<name>/` with `cargo build --target wasm32-wasip2` — one toolchain, no
cargo-component, no jco.

### Serving — `#[rusm_rs::handlers]`

A Rust serving component is a module of `pub fn`s under `#[rusm_rs::handlers]` — **no
`main`, no router, no wire plumbing.** The macro generates the component shell and the
action dispatch; the route is named in that listener's
[`[serve.routes]`](../serving-http-ws-sse.md) subtable as `"component#action"`. A 2-arg action
is buffered; a 3-arg action streams SSE (each request is its own process, so it may
block for the whole connection):

```rust
use rusm_rs::http::{Params, Request, Response, Sse};

#[rusm_rs::handlers]
pub mod api {
    use super::*;

    // GET /users/:id  ->  "api#show"
    pub fn show(_req: Request, p: Params) -> Response {
        Response::text(format!("user {}\n", p.get("id").unwrap_or("?")))
    }

    // GET /events/:room  ->  "api#events"  (3 args → SSE)
    pub fn events(_req: Request, p: Params, sse: Sse) {
        let room = p.get("room").unwrap_or("lobby").to_string();
        for n in 0.. {
            if !sse.data(format!("{room} tick {n}").as_bytes()) { break; } // disconnected
        }
    }
}
```

WebSockets are **per connection**: implement `ws::Handler` and `ws::serve` it. The host
runs one isolated process per connection, hands each inbound frame to `message`, and you
reply through the `Connection` (the per-connection process simply exits on disconnect —
there is no `close` callback):

```rust
use rusm_rs::ws::{self, Connection, Handler};

#[derive(Default)]
struct Echo;

impl Handler for Echo {
    fn open(&mut self, conn: &Connection) { conn.send(b"welcome\n"); }
    fn message(&mut self, conn: &Connection, data: Vec<u8>) { conn.send(&data); } // echo
}

#[rusm_rs::main]
fn main() { ws::serve(Echo::default()); }
```

State that must outlive a request never lives in the serving instance — it goes in a
long-lived `[components.<name>]` service (`resident = true`) reached over the actor API
(`whereis` / `call` / `send`) or in durable `kv`.

## TypeScript guests (`rusm-ts`)

Import the `rusm-ts` package: a **service** is just exported functions, a **worker** is
`export default`. The *concealed typed client* makes `await svc.method(...)` read
like a local call — with `for await` streaming and callback arguments — while
`spawn` / `send` / `receive` stay hidden. `rusm build` bundles each component with
Bun into a small `.js`.

### Serving — web standards

TS serving uses **web standards** (the `#[handlers]` macro is Rust-only) and needs **no
`[serve.routes]` table** — the component *is* the handler. HTTP/SSE is `export default` a
`fetch`-shaped function returning a `Response`; SSE returns a streaming `ReadableStream`
body. WS is `export default websocket({ open, message })` from the `rusm-ts` package —
one worker process per connection:

```ts
// HTTP/SSE — a per-request wasi:http component
export default function handle(request: Request): Response {
  const who = new URL(request.url).searchParams.get("who") ?? "world";
  return new Response(`hello, ${who}\n`, { headers: { "content-type": "text/plain" } });
}
```

```ts
// WS — one worker per connection
import { websocket } from "rusm-ts";

export default websocket({
  open(s)        { s.send("welcome\n"); },
  message(s, d)  { s.send(d); },          // echo
});
```

## Beyond messaging — timers, storage, pub/sub, crypto

Both guests get more than `send`/`receive`, all over the same capability-gated ABI:

- **Timed receive** — `receive_timeout(ms)` (RS) / `Process.receive(ms)` (TS):
  Erlang's `receive … after` — the next message, or `null`/`None` on the deadline.
  The basis for heartbeats and any time-bound wait, with no busy loop.
- **Durable storage** — `rusm_rs::kv` (RS) / the `kv` global (TS): bucketed
  `get`/`set`/`delete`/`exists`/`list` over the node's embedded store
  (`rusm-kv`/redb), gated by the **storage** capability. Survives a restart, no
  external daemon. (TS bundles can also `import` npm — `@noble/*`, etc.)
- **Pub/sub fan-out** — `rusm_rs::pubsub::Topics`: keyed subscriber tracking +
  fan-out + **monitor-based pruning** of dead subscribers (the broker *mechanics* as
  a primitive, so app code carries none of it). Pairs naturally with
  [SSE serving](../serving-http-ws-sse.md): a per-request SSE action subscribes to a
  topic and live-tails it via `Sse::run`, and the monitor prunes the subscriber when the
  request process exits on disconnect.
- **Outbound `fetch` + Web Crypto** (TS): a capability-gated streaming `fetch`, and
  a native **`crypto.subtle`** (RustCrypto: SHA digest, HMAC sign/verify, AES-GCM) —
  so the Anthropic SDK and JWT/signing libraries work inside the sandbox.

## Logging from a component

There's nothing new to learn — **use each language's standard output**, and the host
shows it. A component logs only when its profile grants the **`allow-stdio`** capability
(`[capabilities.<name>] allow-stdio = true`, included in `trusted`); a sandboxed guest's
output is simply discarded.

::: code-group

```rust [Rust]
// Plain std macros → the node's stdout / stderr (when `allow-stdio` is granted).
println!("handled {} in {}ms", id, elapsed);
eprintln!("warning: retrying ({attempt})");
// For levelled/tagged app logs, write a thin helper over eprintln! (no framework
// needed) — or wire the `log`/`tracing` crates to a stderr backend if you prefer.
```

```ts [TypeScript]
// The web-standard console → the node's stderr (warn/error are prefixed).
console.log("handled", id, "in", elapsed, "ms");
console.warn("retrying", attempt);   // → [warn] retrying 2
console.error("gave up");            // → [error] gave up
// Pids (bigint) and objects are stringified/JSON'd for you.
```

:::

These are your **application** logs. They're distinct from the **platform** lifecycle
log (`[log] level = …` → `rusm spawn/exit component#pid …`, [configuration](../reference-configuration.md#log--platform-lifecycle-logging)),
which the runtime emits and tags `rusm` so the two are easy to tell apart on stderr.

## The shared runner — tiny TS components (vs jco)

A TypeScript component is **just its bundle** running on **one shared ~920 KB
rquickjs runner**: the JS engine is compiled once and shared by *every* TS process.
Contrast jco / ComponentizeJS, which bakes a multi-megabyte JS engine (StarlingMonkey)
into **every** component. Ship 50 TS components and RUSM ships the engine **once**,
not fifty times — far smaller and saner.

It's also the only option that keeps a JS guest **inside the Wasm sandbox**: rquickjs
compiles to `wasm32-wasip2`, so a TS guest gets the same memory isolation,
[capabilities](./permissions-and-sandboxing.md) and [preemption](./epoch-preemption.md)
as a Rust one. (A native engine like V8/`deno_core` can't run inside a component.)

## Bytecode precompile

`rusm build` precompiles each bundle to **version-locked QuickJS bytecode**
(`wasm/<name>.qjsbc`); the runner loads it straight into the VM, skipping the parser
on cold start. Full JS + npm is kept — the engine is shared, not embedded per
component.

> Phase 8 (the `rusm-rs` / `rusm-ts` SDKs + the rquickjs runner); bytecode precompile
> is a later optimization on the same shared runner.
