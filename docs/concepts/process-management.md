# Concept — process management (registry, timers, introspection)

Beyond spawn / send / receive, a RUSM process has the full Erlang **management**
toolkit — all backed by the Wasm-free `rusm-otp` core, so it's there whether a
process body is native Rust or a sandboxed Wasm instance.

## Named registry

Register a process under a name so others reach it without holding its pid:
`register(name)` / `whereis(name)`. The registry is a sharded `DashMap` (no global
lock), so lookups scale with cores. For names that resolve across machines, see
[distributed nodes](./distributed-nodes.md).

## Process groups (tags)

Where the registry maps **one name to one pid**, a process group (Erlang's `pg`) maps
**one tag to many pids** — and a process may hold many tags. A process joins a group by
tagging *itself* with `register_tag(tag)` (unprivileged, like `set_label`);
`whereis_tag(tag)` lists the live members; `kill_tag(tag)` terminates the whole group and
returns how many it killed; `unregister_tag(tag)` leaves. Memberships are released on exit
by the **same reaper that releases names**, so a group only ever reports live processes —
and tags add **zero hot-path cost** (an untagged process carries an empty list; the reaper
loops it only at exit).

`kill_tag` is the one privileged op — it terminates *other* processes — so it's gated by
the `process-control` capability exactly like `kill` (a sandboxed guest gets `0`). That
makes process groups the clean primitive for **scoped cancellation**: tag every process
that belongs to one unit of work — say `plan:<id>` for the agents a request spawned — and a
single `kill_tag("plan:<id>")` stops the whole unit immediately and authoritatively. The
application writes only two calls — self-tag on start, gated `kill_tag` to cancel — while
the platform owns the group registry, the reaping, and the gate. No cancel topics, no
polling, no pid bookkeeping in app code.

Same surface from both guests: `register_tag`/`kill_tag`/`whereis_tag` in `rusm-rs`,
`Process.registerTag`/`killTag`/`whereisTag` in `rusm-ts` — backed, like everything here,
by the Wasm-free `rusm-otp` core.

## Timers

`send_after(ms, msg)` schedules a message to land in a mailbox later; `cancel`
aborts a pending one. It's built on Tokio's timer wheel, so millions of outstanding
timers cost almost nothing.

## Introspection

`list()` enumerates live pids; `info(pid)` returns a process's links, monitors,
names, label, mailbox depth and status; `set_label(..)` tags a process for the
observer. This is exactly what the [live-attach](./live-attach.md) REPL and the
dashboard observer read — nothing is hidden from you.

## Lifecycle: graceful shutdown vs kill

`shutdown` drains and stops a process in order; `kill` aborts it immediately via a
`futures` abort handle (no second signal channel — kill rides that handle, exit
signals ride the mailbox). Crashes and exits flow through
[links & supervision](./links-and-supervision.md).

> Registry, timers and graceful shutdown shipped in Phase 4; introspection +
> labels + mailbox depth surface in the observer snapshot.
