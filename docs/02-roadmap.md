# Roadmap — TDD baby steps

Each phase writes the failing test first, then implements until green, and leaves
`cargo test` passing. Every phase "graduates" a dashboard scenario from synthetic
data to real measurements.

> **Foundation-first ordering.** The Erlang model — processes, messaging,
> supervision/fault-tolerance, management, connectivity — is the foundation and
> comes first, built on **native Rust process bodies** so it's real and measurable
> early. **Wasmtime is the execution *backend*, slotted in at Phase 6**: the actor
> layer is designed wasm-ready, so swapping a process body from a native closure to
> a sandboxed Wasm instance is additive, not a rewrite. That's also when
> "task-level" fault isolation becomes "true memory isolation".
>
> **Crate mapping:** Phases 1–5 build the Wasm-free OTP core (`rusm-otp` — usable
> standalone); Phase 6 adds the `rusm-wasm` backend; the `rusm` runtime composes
> them. The OTP layer is *all* of Phases 1–5, not just Phase 1.

| Phase | Theme | Graduates to real data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **0 ✅** | Observability + benchmark dashboard (synthetic) | — |
| **1 ✅** | **Process & scheduler core** — task + process table + abort-based lifecycle, pluggable body | **spawn-storm** (live) |
| **2 ✅** | **Mailboxes & message passing** — per-process mailbox, `send`/`recv`, selective `recv_match` | **ping-pong** (live) |
| **3 ✅** | **Links, monitors, supervision, fault tolerance** — exit reasons, `link`/`monitor`/`trap_exit`/`spawn_link`/`exit`, cascades | **fault-recovery** (live) |
| **4 ✅** | **Process management** — named registry, timers (`send_after`/`cancel`), graceful `shutdown` | — |
| **5 ✅** | **Connectivity: TCP** — `listen`/`connect`, process-per-connection (TLS folds into the Phase 9 secure cluster transport) | **connection-storm** (live) |
| **6 ✅** | **Embed Wasmtime as the process backend** — instance-per-process, host ABI, epoch preemption, pooling + CoW + `InstancePre`; fairness graduated to real Wasm | **fairness** (live) |
| **7 ✅** | **Component hosting** — the **component model** (WASI p2 + p3) via `bridges/`, a `rusm:runtime` WIT actor world (self/send/receive/list/info/kill/register), default-deny capability profiles + memory limits, process introspection, byte streams, and an app model (`rusm.toml [[components]]`, `rusm build`/`dev`). ~440k component spawns/s | **component-storm** (live) |
| 8 | **Guest ergonomics** — `rusm-rs` (Rust guest crate: spawn/Mailbox/AbstractProcess/Supervisor) **and `rusm-ts`** (TS/Bun package giving the same actor API to JS, via the rquickjs↔WIT shell — no jco) | — |
| 9 | **Distributed clusters + live attach** — QUIC+TLS, remote spawn, global registry | **distributed-fanout** |
| 10 | **Performance & hardening** — pooling alloc + CoW + epoch toward 300k/s, hot reload | — |
| 11 | **Standard-WASI surface & wstd compatibility** — invoke the standard `wasi:cli/run` entrypoint (so stock command components run unchanged), host `wasi:http`, and support [`wstd`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wstd)-based guests. RUSM stays a standards-first host; the actor world stays opt-in. (Can be sequenced earlier — `wasi:http` pairs with the HTTP-serving goal.) | — |

## What's shipped so far (Phases 0–7)

- **Phase 0 — observability & harness:** `rusm-metrics`, `rusm-observer`,
  `rusm-bench` (+ WebSocket server), `rusm-cli`, the React dashboard, and this
  docs/VitePress site.
- **Phases 1–5 — the Wasm-free OTP core (`rusm-otp`):** process & scheduler core,
  mailboxes & message passing, links/monitors/supervision, the named registry +
  timers + graceful shutdown, and TCP (process-per-connection).
- **Phase 6 — Wasmtime backend (`rusm-wasm`):** instance-per-process, host ABI,
  epoch preemption, pooling + CoW + `InstancePre`.
- **Phase 7 — component hosting:** the component model (WASI **p2 + p3**) via
  `bridges/{wasip1,wasip2,wasip3}`, the `rusm:runtime` WIT actor world, default-deny
  capabilities, cross-process byte streaming, and the `rusm.toml` app model.
- **Eight live benchmarks** (spawn-storm, ping-pong, fault-recovery,
  connection-storm, fairness, module-storm, component-storm, stream-pipe).
- TDD throughout; coverage ≥98% (mostly 100%); `cargo fmt` + Prettier clean.

See the per-phase deep dives under [`phases/`](./phases/phase-00-foundation.md), and

"borrow vs beat" efficiency playbook we update as each gap closes.
