# Development guide

## Principles

- **TDD always.** Write the failing test first, then implement until green. Baby
  steps — one concept at a time.
- **Coverage: aim for 100%** (≥98% floor). Only genuinely-unreachable invariant
  guards are acceptable gaps, and they should be obvious from the code.
- **Comments only for critical info.** No comments restating obvious code.
- **Senior, idiomatic, DRY, well-separated.** Self-review every change.

## Commands

```sh
# Rust
cargo test                      # all tests (unit + integration)
cargo test -p rusm-metrics      # one crate
cargo fmt --check               # formatting gate
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --ignore-filename-regex 'main\.rs' --summary-only

# Dashboard (Bun, never Node)
cd bench/dashboard
bun install
bun test --coverage
bunx prettier --check src
```

## Where tests live

- **Unit tests**: inline at the bottom of each file in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`
  (idiomatic Rust — they can reach private items, and `#[cfg(test)]` means zero
  cost in release builds).
- **Integration tests**: `<crate>/tests/*.rs` (e.g. the live-server test that
  drives the WebSocket end to end).
- **Dashboard**: pure logic in `*.ts` with `*.test.ts` beside it; presentational
  `.tsx` is excluded from the coverage gate.

## Recipe: add a host function (phase 6+)

1. Write a failing test: a `.wat`/guest module that imports `rusm::<module>::<fn>`
   and asserts the host-observable effect.
2. Define the function on the Wasmtime `Linker`, reading/writing guest memory via
   `Caller` and the per-process `ProcessState` in the `Store`.
3. Make it green; document the function in [`05-host-abi.md`](./05-host-abi.md).
4. Update the relevant `phases/` and `concepts/` doc.

## Coverage notes

`main.rs` files are thin CLI glue and excluded via `--ignore-filename-regex`.
`server.rs` keeps a few defensive async arms (broadcast lag, peer mid-stream
disconnect, accept failure) that only contrived tests could reach — these are the
documented exception, not a gap to paper over with weak tests.
