// rusm.d.ts — ambient types for a RUSM TypeScript component.
//
// A TS component is plain TypeScript, Bun-bundled (`rusm build` → `bun build
// --format=cjs`) and run on the shared rquickjs js-runner. Two shapes:
//
//   • service — `export` functions; RUSM runs the receive→dispatch→reply loop:
//         export function add(a: number, b: number) { return a + b; }
//
//   • worker  — `export default async function () { … }`; RUSM runs it once:
//         export default async function () { const m = await Process.receive(); … }
//
// Reach a service from another component with the typed client:
//         import type * as Calc from "../calc/index";
//         const calc = spawn<typeof Calc>("calc");
//         const sum = await calc.add(2, 3);          // spawn + send + receive, hidden
//
// Reference this file from your entry: /// <reference path="./rusm.d.ts" />
//
// Pids are u64s (too big for a JS number), so they cross as `bigint`. Messages
// and stream chunks are `Uint8Array`, with `*Text` helpers for UTF-8. `receive`
// and `Stream.read` are async (`await`) — the host call suspends the instance's
// fiber, so it's cheap, and they compose with other Promises.
